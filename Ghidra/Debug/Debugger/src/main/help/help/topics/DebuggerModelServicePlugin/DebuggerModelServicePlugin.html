    <H1><A name="plugin"></A>Debugger: Model Service</H1>

    <P>This service plugin backs the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerTargetsPlugin/DebuggerTargetsPlugin.html">Targets</A> window. It maintains
    all debugger connections across the entire Ghidra session, that is, they're shared across all
    tools.</P>

    <H2>Actions</H2>

    <P>The plugin also provides some shortcut actions.</P>

    <H3><A name="debug_program"></A> Debug Program</H3>

    <P>This action is available whenever a program is opened, and the current program indicates an
    "executable path" that exists on the local file system and is marked executable by the host
    operating system. It will launch a suitable connection for debugging local applications, and
    then run the current program in that debugger. If <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerObjectsPlugin/DebuggerObjectsPlugin.html#record_automatically">Record
    Automatically</A> is enabled, this will provide a one-click action to debug the current
    program. This is similar to the <A href=
    "help/topics/DebuggerObjectsPlugin/DebuggerObjectsPlugin.html#quick_launch">Quick Launch</A>
    action in the Commands and Objects window, except this one creates a new connection.</P>

    <H3><A name="disconnect_all"></A> Disconnect All</H3>

    <P>This action is always available from the main application window. It closes all debugger
    connections, no matter what tool created them. This is a sort of panic and reset action.</P>
